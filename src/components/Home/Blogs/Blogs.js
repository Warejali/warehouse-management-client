                <h3 className='mb-2'>What is the purpose of JWT? </h3>
                <p>JWT mainly use for login security. becouse JWT is an open standard used to share security information between two parties (A) client (B) server.
                    Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.
                </p>
                <h3 className='mb-2'>how does JWT work? </h3>
                <p>
                    JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.

                    A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using base64. In the most common serialization format, compact serialization, the JWT looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz.

            <h3 className='mb-2'>When should you use 'nodejs' and when should you use 'mongodb'?</h3>
                <p>
                    Node Js is a command-line tool that can be run as a regular web server and lets one run JavaScript programs.
                    Node Js is very good when you need to do several things at the same time. <br /><br /><br />

                    NoSQL databases like MongoDB are a good choice when your data is document-centric and doesnâ€™t fit well into the schema of a relational database, when you need to accommodate massive scale, when you are rapidly prototyping, and a few other use cases.
                    MongoDB is the most popular of the new breed of non-relational NoSQL databases.
